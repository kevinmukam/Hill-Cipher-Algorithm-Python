# Hill-and-Vigenere-Cryptography-Python
The python codes for Hill and Vigenere encryption/decryption algorithms written by Kevin Mukam

Hill encryption algorithm takes m successive plaintext let- ters and substitutes for them m ciphertext letters. The substitution is determined by m linear equations in which each character is assigned a numerical value (a = 0, b = 1, c , z = 25).
