# Hill-and-Vigenere-Cryptography-Python
The python codes for Hill and Vigenere encryption/decryption algorithms written by Kevin Mukam

Hill encryption algorithm takes m successive plaintext let- ters and substitutes for them m ciphertext letters. The substitution is determined by m linear equations in which each character is assigned a numerical value (a = 0, b = 1, c , z = 25).

In Viginere cryptography, the set of related monoalphabetic substitution rules consists of the 26 Caesar ciphers with shifts of 0 through 25. Each cipher is denoted by a key letter, which is the ciphertext letter that substitutes for the plain- text letter a. Thus, a Caesar cipher with a shift of 3 is denoted by the key value 3.
